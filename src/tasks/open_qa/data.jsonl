{"input": "What causes rainbows to appear in the sky?", "expected_output": "Rainbows appear when sunlight is refracted, dispersed, and reflected inside water droplets in the atmosphere, separating white light into its component colors."}
{"input": "Why do leaves change color in autumn?", "expected_output": "Leaves change color because chlorophyll breaks down as days shorten, revealing yellow and orange pigments, while red pigments are produced from trapped sugars."}
{"input": "How do vaccines work to protect against diseases?", "expected_output": "Vaccines introduce a weakened or inactive form of a pathogen to train the immune system to recognize and fight the real disease without causing illness."}
{"input": "What makes the ocean appear blue?", "expected_output": "The ocean appears blue because water absorbs red wavelengths of light more than blue, and it also reflects the blue color of the sky."}
{"input": "Why do we yawn and is it really contagious?", "expected_output": "Yawning may help cool the brain or increase alertness. It appears contagious due to a form of social mirroring linked to empathy."}
{"input": "How do airplanes stay in the air?", "expected_output": "Airplanes fly due to lift generated by air moving faster over the curved top of wings than below, creating lower pressure above the wing."}
{"input": "What causes earthquakes?", "expected_output": "Earthquakes are caused by the sudden release of energy when tectonic plates shift, collide, or slide past each other along fault lines."}
{"input": "Why is the sky dark at night?", "expected_output": "The sky is dark at night because Earth rotates away from the Sun, and despite many stars, the universe is too vast and expanding for their light to fill the sky."}
{"input": "How does memory work in the human brain?", "expected_output": "Memory works through encoding, storage, and retrieval of information via neural connections that strengthen with repetition and emotional significance."}
{"input": "What causes thunder during a storm?", "expected_output": "Thunder is caused by the rapid expansion of air heated by lightning, creating a shockwave that we hear as a rumbling or cracking sound."}
